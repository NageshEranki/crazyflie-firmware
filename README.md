# Crazyflie Firmware  [![CI](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This project contains the source code for the firmware used in the Crazyflie range of platforms, including the Crazyflie 2.X and the Roadrunner.

## Branch summaries:

- `master` : This version of the firmware is mostly template code that can be flashed for normal usage.
- `direct_feedback_control` : Use Motion capture directly for position and velocity feedback in the tracking controller. The custom control loop simply forwards calls to the default PID controller. This version of the firmware was designed to study the effects of motion capture rates on controller performance.
- `z_state_encoding` : Use motion capture but send encoded, or compressed position/velocity feedback for altitude. The control loop first unpacks the encoded data and updates its state estimates according to [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1186780). The control loop then applies control input by forwarding calls to the stock PID controller.

### Crazyflie 1.0 support

The 2017.06 release was the last release with Crazyflie 1.0 support. If you want
to play with the Crazyflie 1.0 and modify the code, please clone this repo and
branch off from the 2017.06 tag.

## Building and Flashing
